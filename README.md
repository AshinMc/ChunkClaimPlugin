# ChunkClaimPlugin
This is my first spigot plugin for Minecraft 1.20.6

## Commands
1. /claimchunk: Claim the chunk you are standing in.
2. /unclaimchunk: Unclaim the chunk you are standing in.
3. /checkchunk: Check the ownership of the chunk you are standing in.
4. /infochunk: Get a list of your claimed chunks.
5. /visualizechunk: Visualize the borders of the chunk you are standing in.
 
## Current situation
The plugin is buggy and not working as intended.
