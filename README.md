# ChunkClaimPlugin
This is my first spigot plugin for Minecraft 1.20.6

## Commands
1. /claimchunk:
    description: Claim the chunk you are standing in.
2. /unclaimchunk:
    description: Unclaim the chunk you are standing in.
3. /checkchunk:
    description: Check the ownership of the chunk you are standing in.
4. /infochunk:
    description: Get a list of your claimed chunks.
5. /visualizechunk:
    description: Visualize the borders of the chunk you are standing in.
 
## Current situation
The plugin is buggy and not working as intended.
